### Scaffold-GS: Structured 3D Gaussians for View-Adaptive Rendering

Scaffold-GS establishes a hierarchical and region-aware 3D scene representation by utilizing anchor points and a sparse grid initiated from Structure from Motion (SfM) points. Each anchor tethers neural Gaussians with learnable offsets, dynamically predicting their attributes - opacity, color, rotation, and scale - based on the anchor feature and viewing position. The method constrains the distribution of 3D Gaussians using scene structure, allowing local adaptation to varying viewing angles and distances. Anchor growing and pruning operations are developed to enhance scene coverage. During inference, neural Gaussians are predicted within the view frustum, and trivial Gaussians are filtered out based on opacity, enabling efficient rendering with reduced storage requirements.
