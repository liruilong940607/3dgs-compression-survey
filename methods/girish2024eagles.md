### EAGLES: Efficient Accelerated 3D Gaussians with Lightweight EncodingS


This approach aims to decrease both storage and runtime memory costs while enhancing training and rendering speeds and maintaining view synthesis quality. The authors observed that the color and rotation attributes account for over 80% of memory usage; thus, they propose compressing these attributes via a latent quantization framework. Additionally, they quantize the opacity coefficients of the Gaussians, improving optimization and resulting in fewer floaters or visual artifacts in novel view reconstructions. To reduce the number of redundant Gaussians resulting from frequent densification (via cloning and splitting), the approach employs a pruning stage to identify and remove Gaussians with minimal influence on the full reconstruction. This reduction in the number of Gaussians further decreases the memory cost of the scene representation and enhances rendering and training speeds through faster rasterization.
