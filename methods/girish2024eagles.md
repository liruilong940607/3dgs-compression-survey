### EAGLES: Efficient Accelerated 3D Gaussians with Lightweight EncodingS


The authors of this approach observed that in 3DGS, the color and rotation attributes account for over 80% of memory usage; thus, they propose compressing these attributes via a latent quantization framework. Additionally, they quantize the opacity coefficients of the Gaussians, improving optimization and resulting in fewer floaters or visual artifacts in novel view reconstructions. To reduce the number of redundant Gaussians resulting from frequent densification (via cloning and splitting), the approach employs a pruning stage to identify and remove Gaussians with minimal influence on the full reconstruction. For this, an influence metric is introduced, which considers both opacity and transmittance.
