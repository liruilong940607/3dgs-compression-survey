### Compact3D: Compressing Gaussian Splat Radiance Field Models with Vector Quantization

This approach introduces a vector quantization method based on the K-means algorithm to quantize the Gaussian parameters in 3D Gaussian splatting, as many Gaussians may share similar parameters. Only a small codebook is stored along with the index of the code for each Gaussian, resulting in a large reduction in the storage of the learned radiance fields and a reduction of the memory footprint at rendering time. Additionally, the indices are further compressed by sorting the Gaussians based on one of the quantized parameters and storing the indices using a method similar to Run-Length-Encoding (RLE). To reduce the number of Gaussians, this method applies a regularizer to encourage zero opacity, before pruning Gaussians with opacity smaller than a threshold.
