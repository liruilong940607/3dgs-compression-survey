### Reducing the Memory Footprint of 3D Gaussian Splatting

This approach addresses three main issues contributing to large storage sizes in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). To reduce the number of 3D Gaussian primitives, the authors introduce a scale- and resolution-aware redundant primitive removal method. This extends opacity-based pruning by incorporating a redundancy score to identify regions with many low-impact primitives. To mitigate storage size due to spherical harmonic coefficients, they propose adaptive adjustment of spherical harmonic (SH) bands. This involves evaluating color consistency across views and reducing higher-order SH bands when view-dependent effects are minimal. Additionally, recognizing the limited need for high dynamic range and precision for most primitive attributes, they develop a codebook using K-means clustering and apply 16-bit half-float quantization to the remaining uncompressed floating point values.
