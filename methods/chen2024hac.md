### HAC: Hash-grid Assisted Context for 3D Gaussian Splatting Compression

The paper proposes a Hash-grid Assisted Context (HAC) framework for compressing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models by leveraging the mutual information between attributes of unorganized 3D Gaussians (anchors) and hash grid features. Using Scaffold-GS as a base model, HAC queries the hash grid by anchor location to predict anchor attribute distributions for efficient entropy coding. The framework introduces an Adaptive Quantization Module (AQM) to dynamically adjust quantization step sizes and employs adaptive offset masking with learnable masks to prune unnecessary data for further compression. Extensive experiments show that HAC achieves significant compression ratios while maintaining or improving rendering fidelity.
