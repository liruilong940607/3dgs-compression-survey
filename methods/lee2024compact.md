### Compact 3D Gaussian Representation for Radiance Field

This approach aims to reduce the number of Gaussian points neccecary for 3D Gaussian splat representations without sacrificing performance, and to compresse the Gaussian attributes, such as view-dependent color and covariance. The authors observe current densification algorithm to produces
many redundant and unnecessary Gaussians, resulting in high memory and storage requirements. Thus, they introduce a novel volume-based masking strategy that identifies and removes non-essential Gaussians that have minimal impact on overall performance. Furthermore, they exploit spatial redundancy by incorporating a grid-based (Instant-NGP) neural field to efficiently represent view-dependent colors rather than using per Gaussian color attributes. Given that the geometry of the Gaussians is expected to have limited variation in scale and rotation, this approach employs a compact codebook-based representation, which is designed to identify similar patterns or geometries shared across each scene.
