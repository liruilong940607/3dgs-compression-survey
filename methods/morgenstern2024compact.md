### Compact 3D Scene Representation via Self-Organizing Gaussian Grids

Compressing 3D data is challenging, but many effective solutions exist for compressing 2D data (such as images). The authors propose a new method to organize 3DGS parameters into a 2D grid, drastically reducing storage requirements without compromising visual quality. This organization exploits perceptual redundancies in natural scenes. They introduce a highly parallel sorting algorithm, PLAS, which arranges Gaussian parameters into a 2D grid, maintaining local neighborhood structure and ensuring smoothness. This solution is particularly innovative because no existing method efficiently handles a 2D grid with millions of points. During training, a smoothness loss is applied to enforce local smoothness in the 2D grid, enhancing the compressibility of the data. 
The key insight is that smoothness needs to be enforced during training to enable efficient compression.
