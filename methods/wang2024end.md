### End-to-End Rate-Distortion Optimized 3D Gaussian Representation

This paper introduces RDO-Gaussian, an end-to-end Rate-Distortion Optimized 3D Gaussian representation. The authors achieve flexible, continuous rate control by formulating 3D Gaussian representation learning as a joint optimization of rate and distortion. Rate-distortion optimization is realized through dynamic pruning and entropy-constrained vector quantization (ECVQ). Gaussian pruning involves learning a mask to eliminate redundant Gaussians and adaptive SHs pruning assigns varying SH degrees to each Gaussian based on material and illumination needs. The covariance and color attributes are discretized through ECVQ, which performs vector quantization.
