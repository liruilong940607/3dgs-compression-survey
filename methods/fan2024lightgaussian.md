### LightGaussian: Unbounded 3D Gaussian Compression with 15x Reduction and 200+ FPS

LightGaussian aims to transform 3D Gaussians to a more efficient and compact form, avoiding the scalablity issues that arrises from the large number of SfM (Structure from Motion) points for unbounded scenes. Inspired by Network Pruning, the method identifies Gaussians that minimally contribute to scene reconstruction and employs a pruning and recovery process, thereby efficiently reducing redundancy in Gaussian counts while maintaining visual effects. Additionally, LightGaussian utilizes knowledge distillation and pseudo-view augmentation to transfer spherical harmonics efficients to a lower degree. Furthermore, the authors propose a Gaussian Vector Quantization based on the global significance of Gaussians to quantize all redundant attributes, achieving lower bitwidth representations with minimal accuracy losses.
